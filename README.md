# 🚢 Titanic Data Visualization Project

This project showcases **data analysis and visual storytelling** using the classic [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The goal is to explore the dataset and uncover patterns related to passenger survival using **interactive and static visualizations**.

> 🔍 Developed for **Celebl** as part of a data visualization case study.

---

## 📊 Objectives

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.
- Identify key factors affecting passenger survival.
- Visualize insights using tools like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**.
- Generate business-relevant interpretations for stakeholders.

## 📁 Dataset Used

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- Features include:
  - `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (optional for interactivity)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Gender impact**: Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- **Class matters**: Passengers in **1st class** were more likely to survive.
- **Age groups**: Children and young adults had better survival chances.
- **Embarkation**: Port of embarkation had correlations with survival rate.

*(Detailed visualizations are available in the notebook.)*
